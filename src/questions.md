Avoid asking binary questions ("do you have any questions -> what did I miss?")

Knowledge creates blindless, removes curosity. An approach to resolving a complex problem - get everyone in the room, _everyone_ responsible for end-to-end production of a unit of work, one rule "only allowed to ask questions" - shutdown any solutioning. Everyone, asking questions. Multiple days/weeks if need be. Then top-to-bottom verify the answers to the question as a seperate event.

Instead of voting with yes/no, vote with number of fingers. Capture the middle/difference of thought instead of filtering it out. Use something such as https://www.polleverywhere.com/plans to create a clickable image.
