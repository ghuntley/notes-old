Consider some people need to write their thoughts. Writing is a form of defragging. If you aren't connecting, get them to reply to the message in their own words.


Don't have an agenda in mind. Ask coachee their thoughts, ask good questions. Get to values and desires.

> When knowledge is high, curiosity is low. Knowledge prevents courisity. Be curious.

> To create and sustain Change, you've got to act more like a coach and less like a scorekeeper. It requires geniune care for the individual. 

> be careful when asking questions that you don't come off as judging
