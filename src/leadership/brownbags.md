A brown-bag is an informal meeting that occurs around lunchtime. It is referred to as a brown bag meeting because participants typically bring their lunches often packed in brown paper bags.

The format of a brown-bag typically is as follows:

    Anyone may attend and folks from different backgrounds are welcome
    Attendance is optional and you can bring your food
    Someone who wants to share something with others (idea, practice, experience)
    People who want to learn from that someone
    A facilitator

We hope that this could be a start of an ongoing thing within $client on a variety of topics - everything from group knitting lessons, insights learned from automating your house or sharing ideas on how to improve practices within $client.
