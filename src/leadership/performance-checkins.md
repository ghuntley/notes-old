# rubiks

## setting goals

- Y -> Why
- S -> specifics
- T -> time
- O -> others
- R -> realistic
- M -> measure

## grading
- are expectations documented? compare against documented expectations (*look at the role position*)
- 0,0 middle min expectation (doing fine)
- split it down into grids
- don't do both axis as once
    - do the behaviour axis
    - do the performance axis


# authoring feedback
- how could you have served the person better?
- what has that person done in this quarter (look at notes, review commits, review JIRA stories assigned to person)
- what has the person proposed this quarter (review stories created by person)
- what feedback have you provided?
- what feedback have their peers provided?
- if there's feedback missing then introspect why, what can I do to lift that person?
- what feedback was authored by the person and their manager in the previous quarters? do a retrospective, any themes or opportunities?
- how has that person grown?
- has the person provided any personal feedback at ghuntley.com/feedback?
- what's your commitment?
- what's their commitment?


# reviewing feedback
- it's the differences in the grading rubic between manager/employee and the conversations it drives (ie any perception gaps on either side) is where the value is at.
- how we do things matters, not just what we do, are we showing care? (ie shipping isn't enough, you must be followable)
- recogition
- after written feedback as part of a quarterly cycle it's best to wait 4hrs-24hrs to give folks more time to process, failure to do this means the meeting will be more emotionally charged and less productive for all parties.
- bring data
- where is there competence, clarity, control? - https://srinathramakrishnan.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/brief-summary-of-turn-the-ship-around.pdf
- okr
- wholistic pov of a persons contribution and value they bring to a company
- check (ask for feedback / reduce intention - perception gaps)
- people need to be ready for career conversations, decisions should come from them, not you.

# follow up excercises
- define a [personal commitment](../personal-commitment)
