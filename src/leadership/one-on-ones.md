- focus on the human, not just unblocking them
- ask do you want advice and a shoulder?
- regularly ask for feedback on 1:1s to reduce intention / perception gap
- remind people of victories (reinforce wins/the past, don't focus on blockers/the future)
- reflect on the journey
- parition operational out into a seperate meeting (ie 10mins at start of week with each person that is operational update instead)
- coaching to develop the whole human as part of one on ones
- don't jump in and fix things automatically as that may rob folks of their personal development opportunities.
