# fault injection

- storming to performing
- for too long becomes safe, group think becomes stale
- innovation, risks and growth come from a steady flow of transitioning backwards and forwards between storming and performing

# ripples

- me
- team
- org


# investing in the right people

The first step of people development is to have a critera as to whom should be developed:

- makes things happen
- see and seize opportunities
- influence the opinions and actions of others
- add vbaluye to you and others
- attract winners to them
- equip others
- offer ideas that help the organization
- possess a grteat attitude
- live up to their commitements and responsibilities
- show fierce loyalty to the organization and the leader

# mindfulness

"As a leader, you have the ability to set the tempature of the room, not just read it. You have the power and responsibility to change the norm."

"I'm not the best right now, going through something personal. It's me, not you."

## 1 Position ↔ Rights
My influence on this person is based primarily on my position. This person may be someone who reports to me but who I do not know very well. Or it could be someone who reports to me but with whom I do not have a very good relationship. This does not have to be a direct report. It may be someone else I influence through my position. This could be someone in a completely different department or organisation.

## 3 Production ↔ Results
This is a relationship that has been strengthened over time based largely on our proven ability to get things done together. I am able to influence this person because this individual knows that if he or she signs up to follow me they can expect to partner with me in creating success and that they will have fun doing it. Leading at this level is a true measure of performance. Either you are producing results or you're not. When you produce you attract other producers. At the ultimate level you obtain _production_ through _others_.


### individual production retro
- problems I'm currently trying to resolve (restrict WIP)
- things I accomplish in a typical week (minimise this)
- decisions I currently need to make (maximize this but restrict WIP)

### team production retro
Reflect on the following then take the lowest score and make it the target:

- how effective am I when supporting other team memebrs in their work?
- how effective am I in training and developing others?
- how effective am I in giving feedback to others?
- how effective am I in getting to know my team, knowning their strengths and weeknesses?

### momentum

to build momentum:

- focus on tasks that promote the vision
- do a few things really well.
- spend 80% of your time in your strength area but get out of your comfort area
- be a change agent
- make difficult decisions

to slow momentum:

- focus on busy work and putting out fires
- do everything marginally well
- continiuously work on fixing your weaknesses

- beging to develop your people into a team

- Don't control people, align passions. Successful leaders align the passions of their teammates with orgamnizational mission.
- Look beyond symptom to cause - leaders who are always putting out fires haven't addreessed the root issue.
- go from complexirty to simplicity - high performance leaders cut away atr complexitiy until simplicity merges. great leaders imopliofy
- create clarifym overcommunicate clarify, reinforce clarify - most people don;'t have the discipline or endurance to bear the frustruction of pursing clarity

## 4 People ↔ Reproduction
This is someone who is now growing and developing largely due to the influence I have had on this person over a period of time. If I am young in my leadership journey (not the same as in age) I may not have yet developed this level of leadership. If that's the case, then I will leave this blank for now.

# leaders at every level

A team has their preferred, default comfortable level. A team can be trained to operate at a particular level, in crisis they will potentially rever to their preferred, default comfortable level. ie the in-grained behavior.

- 7. What have you BEEN DOING? I've BEEN DOING...
- 6. What have you DONE? I've DONE ...
- 5. What do you INTEND to do? I INTEND to ...
- 4. What would you LIKE to do? I would LIKE to ...
- 3. What do you THINK? I THINK ...
- 2. What do you SEE? I SEE ...
- 1. I'll TELL you what to do. TELL me what to do.

The "What do you INTEND to do? I INTEND to ..." works best with trust. Ensure that people understand that it's a "i'd like your insights" and not a "I'm sharing this with you because we don't trust each other".

The more we can get people to level five the better [exception - times of crisis]
