# abstract 
> The Church-Turing Thesis confuses numerical computations with symbolic computations. In particular, any model of computability in which
equality is not definable, such as the λ-models underpinning higher-order programming languages, is not equivalent to the Turing model. However,
a modern combinatory calculus, the SF-calculus, can define equality of its closed normal forms, and so yields a model of computability that is
equivalent to the Turing model. This has profound implications for programming language design -
