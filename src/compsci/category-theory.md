# The principle of Sameness

```
8 + 1 = 1 + 8
2 x 5 = 5 x 2
(8+5) +5 = 8 + (5+5)

The concept of invertibility - "if I go over here can I go back?"

Whole categories can be isomorphic if the arrows look the same. 
The first row is isomorphic because the arrows go the same way, the bottom row isn't isomorphic.
