Ramadan is one of the holiest months of the Islamic calendar.  During the month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset for roughly 30 days as required by the religion. It's period of reflection to "starve the body in order to nourish the soul" as an act of consideration of those with less privledge/that are less fortunate than themselves. All food, drink _and_ water is forbidden between dawn until dusk.

In order to stay well-nourished for the day of fasting ahead Muslims wake up before the sun rises to eat, known as `suhoor`. If a person is observing and sleeps in it can be one of the worst feelings in the world. The moment the sun rises is known as `Fajr` or dawn.

`Iftar` is the first meal that Muslims have upon breaking their fast at sunset which is known as `Maghrib` in Arabic. There are sermons and Quran recitals which amp up over the last 10 nights which is considered the holiest time of the month of Ramadan.

The end of Ramadan is an important religious holiday known as `Eid al-Fitr` that marks the end of fasting. It's typically starts with a morning prayer, the gathering of family and friends with lots of food/sweets. Kidlets get `Ediya` which is basically money.
