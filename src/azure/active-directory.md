# Initial Domain Name
The initial domain name is established when the directory was created by the admin, and it _can't be changed or deleted_. If you get it wrong you'll need to ditch the directory and create a new one with the correct name. The directory name will show all through Office 365, especially in SharePoint domains so it is extremely important to get it right the first time around.
