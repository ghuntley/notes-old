# retrospective

Someone other than the team or product lead should facilitate. Sharing the
facilitation around the team keeps retrospectives fresh, encourages greater
participation, and uncovers more inconvenient truths.

Set the boundary of the discussion and be clear how far back the team is going
to go:

- are we discussing the last sprint? 
- the last quarter?
- going all the way back since the project started? 

The team does retrospectives because they provide a roll-up summary for project
[post mortems](http://antitrust.slated.org/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/8000/PX08875.pdf) and we know that without them projects turn into death marches. Having a
reserved period of time allows us to inspect, adapt and improve our processes
and techniques. We value working smater, not harder. 

## agenda

standard play:

- set the boundary of the discussion (5 min)
- what went well? (10 min)
- what needs improvement? (10 min)
- were there any regressions? (5 min)
- next steps (5 min)

the four l's:

- what did you like? (5 min)
- what was lacking? (5 min)
- what did you learn? (5 min)
- what do you long for going forward? (5 min)
- were there any regressions? (5 min)

map out the past two months (10 min):

- on the whiteboard, draw a timeline spanning the past two months. Then have
  team members call out significant events: iteration/sprint starts, releases,
victories, discoveries, or anything else that had an impact on your work.
- do this activity at the start of the meeting to foster a shared sense of
  achievement, solidarity and help refresh everyone's memory.

# sprint kick-off

The purpose of this meeting is to agree upon which work will be done, at a high
level agree how it will be done and incorporate learnings from the
retrospective. If the refinement has been done successfully then there should
be minimal definition activities during kick-off.

## agenda

define the scope:
 
- what is the goal for this sprint?
- identify any holidays, conference or other activites that will impact sprint
  capacity?
- filter what items to include in the sprint based on the sprint goal and the
  team's capacity.

plan the execution:

- apply learnings from retrospectives
- identity tasks for the backlog items and whether there are any dependencies
  between the items.
- maximise autonomny of stories and minimise people dependencies.
- why is the team confident that they'll be able to meet the sprint goal?

execute:

- allocate tasks based on self-selection rather than assignment by a third
  party.

# refinement

The purpose of this meeting is to identify risk, define what work will be done
in the future and inspect progress of the current sprint.

## agenda

plan for the future:

- split features into stories, stories into tasks
- assign estimates to stories which have yet to receive one

inspect the sprint:

- is the definition of done being adhered to?
- are we on track? What can we point to as being done?
- do we need to create marketing artifacts for sharing progress to folks
  outside of the team?
- remove any user stories that no longer appear relevant
- re-assesses the relative priority of stories
- creating new user stories in response to newly discovered needs
- correct estimates in light of newly discovered information


# standup

As a team we get together daily to share learnings, call out risk and ask for
help. We do this to help us to achieve the sprint goal.

## agenda

- do you need help from someone? ask
- how could folks help you? share
- are we going to meet the sprint commitment? identify concerns or risks
