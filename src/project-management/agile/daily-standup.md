# why 

As a team we get together daily to share learnings, call out risk and ask for
help. We do this:

* as a way of sharing your intentions with the team
* to ensure people are getting all the help they need to do the best possible work
* to highlight where conflict/risk exists to prevent avoidance and escalation
* to create artifacts that demonstrate accountability

High-performing teams have one thing in common: psychological safety, the belief that you won't be punished when you make a mistake or "being able to show and employ one's self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status or career"

Psychological safety is important as it enables moderate risk-taking, speaking your mind, creativity, and sticking your neck out without fear of having it cut off â€” just the types of behavior that lead to market breakthroughs that are asked from this team. 

TL;DR - Please overshare during standup. Be awesome to each other and if something's not right please start a discussion with your 1-up.

# implementation

Every morning at around 830am a robot in slack ("@Geekbot") will send ask you a series of questions if you have Slack open. Here are the questions that are asked:

- do you need help from someone? ask
- how could folks help you? share
- have you identified any new risks? customer, sprint or internal commitments

You can personally customise the timings when @Geekbot activates by heading over to: <redacted>

Remember:

* "There's no team without trust"
* "Autonomy and privileges comes with responsibility + accountability"
