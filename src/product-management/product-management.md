One way to think about what product management is, it's a business strategy role.


# product development cycles
conceive, plan, develop, iterate, launch, steady state, maintain or kill

## conceive
* generate problem hyptheses
* use design thinking
* spend time with users/customers
* synthesis with research: market, competitive, company
* brainstorm problem -idea space
* call out assumptions

> Problem: "I can never find a cab when I need one"
> Hypothesis: "If customers could reliably schedule a ride from their phone, they would no longer hail a cab from the street.

## plan
* validate your hyptoteheses
* use research to remove assumptions
* focus on the right users

* project timelines
* resources required to solve this problem

## launch
